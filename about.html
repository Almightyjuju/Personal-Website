        <h2>Boxing</h2>
        <p>
          I first began to box in 2012 wen I was 11 Years old. I weighed no more
          then 55 lbs. I was told I was too small to compete and it crushed my
          spirit. Five years later on my 16th birthday I decided to walk back
          into the gym and prove everyone wrong. I pushed myself and worked
          twice as hard as the person next to me. I made the amature team, won
          Louisiana Golden Gloves in 2020, and a year later I turned pro. I am
          now 3-1 as a professional with 2 kos.
        </p>
        <p>
          I owe it all to boxing. Boxing has opended many doors and
          opportunities, like allowing me to compete in 12 different states it
          has even brought me all the way to Cartagena, Colombia were I competed
          twice as a pro. It has shaped me into the person I am today. It has
          taught me to never give up to always chase what's important to you and
          without hard work, prayer is nothing. It has taught me to be
          disciplined, patient and honest with myself.

        <h2>Hiking</h2>
        <p>
          Hiking in nature is such a beautiful experience! The fresh air,
          beautiful scenery, and the feeling of being surrounded by many
          different living things such as bugs, and animals is truly amazing.
          Everyone plays a huge and important role. It's a chance to escape the
          hustle and have peace of mind, connecting with the things around me.
          Hiking is also a great way to stay active and challange myself
          physically. Whether its conquering a steep trail or climbing a tree,
          hiking always brings a sense of adventure and peace.

        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>
          I love to learn and challenge myself. I believe there is nothing
          cooler than setting a goal and achieving it. One of my goals this year
          is to graduate from Fullstack and become a software developer. On my
          free time I love to read books and expand my vocabulary. I am fluent
          in english and spanish, and I am self teaching myself italian.
